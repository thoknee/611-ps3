CS611: Assignment 2 Dots and Boxes

Teammates: Antony Ponomarev and Olivia Ma

This is a terminal based simple game engine made completely in java. The high level idea is to create a game engine that is easily extendable to add other games - especially those based on a grid system like the two games currently implemented.

Currently, this game engine has 2 games.
- Sliding puzzle
- Dots and boxes

Sliding puzzle is an old school puzzle you have probably played at least once in your life. It is a one player game where the objective is to fix the numbers in chronological order being able to move them one at a time through an empty space.

Dots and boxes is a 2 player game where you face off against an opponent. The game starts with an array of dots of which every turn you can connect with a line. Upon completing an entire box with 4 lines you get 1 point and the player with more points wins.

To use this game engine it is quite simple. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory in which the files exist. From there, you need to compile the Main.java as so:

```javac Main.java```

Upon finishing compilation, you can then simply run the code using the following command:

```java Main```

Upon running it with this command you should be prompted with an introduction and all the information you need to be able to play either game. Have fun playing!


Prominent Files: 

- Main.java – Entry point to the application. Initializes the configuration, players, and starts the RunDotsAndBoxes game.

- RunDotsAndBoxes.java – Manages the overall game flow and turn sequence, prompting users for moves, handling scoring, and determining when the game ends. Allows players to quit mid-game or play again after finishing.

- dbGame.java – Core logic for Dots and Boxes gameplay. Handles edge claiming, box completion, scoring, and determining when the game is over.

- dbDisplay.java – Responsible for displaying the board in the console, including box edges, player colors, and ownership.

- dbPiece.java – Represents an individual box in the grid. Tracks which edges are claimed and which player owns the box (if completed).

- Board.java – Stores the state of the entire grid, including all boxes and edges. Provides helper methods for accessing and updating board data.

- Player.java – Holds player information, including name, color, and score.

- Config.java – Stores configuration details such as player setup and board dimensions.

- ConsoleInput.java – Handles validated user input from the console, ensuring numeric ranges and providing prompts.

- Edge.java – Enum for edge positions (TOP, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT) with helper conversion methods.


Note: Example below does not include color, but colors are printed on the terminal via ANSI escape sequences. 


Input/Output Example (Summary)

Everything ending with a ‘?’ or ‘:’ is an input prompt, and everything else is printed output.
